    <h3>My Favorite Story But Short Version</h3>
    <p>Jesus of Nazareth was born in Bethlehem to Mary and Joseph. He grew up a sinless life. He preached about love, forgiveness, and his Father's Kingdom, performing miracles. Jesus was eventually betrayed by one of his disciple, Judas, and was arrested. He was tried by the Romans and sentenced to death by crucifixtion. Jesus would die on the cross and taking all sin with him. He would be resurrected in three days later. He would offer eternal life to those who believe in him and ascended to heaven.</p>
